		<h1>Extremadura Recipe</h1>
		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 1</h3>
				Grease pie dish with unsalted butter, then lightly dust with all-purpose
				flour, shaking out excess. Whisk 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton
				kosher salt, 1 tsp. sugar, and 2½ cups (313 g) all-purpose flour in a
				large bowl to combine. Add 1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut
				into small pieces, and toss to coat. Working quickly and aggressively,
				rub and smash butter into dry ingredients with your fingers to create
				shaggy pieces (you want some that are flat and thin and some that are
				pea-size).
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 2</h3>
				Combine 4 tsp. gin or vodka or ice water and 4 tsp. ice water in a small
				bowl; drizzle over flour mixture, stirring with a fork to evenly
				distribute. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it
				will still look a little dry). Turn dough out onto a surface and knead 1
				or 2 more times to incorporate shaggy edges. Press into a 1"-thick disk.
				Wrap tightly in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 3</h3>
				Roll out disk of dough on a lightly floured surface to ¼" thick.
				Carefully transfer to pie dish. Lift up edges and allow dough to slump
				down into dish. Gently press into edges of dish if needed. Trim overhang
				so dough is flush with edges of pan. Freeze crust at least 1 hour and up
				to 1 week. Custard and assembly
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 4</h3>
				Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°. Heat 2½ cups (500 g)
				sugar and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium, whisking
				occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Transfer syrup
				to a small bowl and let cool.
			</li>

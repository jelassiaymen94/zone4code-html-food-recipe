		<h1>Papardelle Recipe</h1>
		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 1</h3>
				Pour 1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil into a cold large skillet; arrange 2
				thin slices prosciutto in an even layer in pan. Set over medium-low heat
				and cook, turning occasionally, until prosciutto is crisp, 5–7 minutes.
				Transfer to paper towels to drain; set aside. Reserve skillet.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 2</h3>
				Cook one 8-oz. package Trader Joe’s egg pappardelle pasta or 8 oz. other
				dried pappardelle in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente.
				Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 3</h3>
				Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in reserved
				skillet over medium-low. Cook 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped, stirring,
				until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Pour in ½ cup heavy cream, increase
				heat to medium, and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits
				stuck to bottom of pan with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring often, until
				sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes; reduce heat to low. Using a
				Microplane, finely grate zest of 1 lemon into sauce. Cut lemon in half
				and squeeze in juice from 1 half. Cut remaining lemon half into wedges;
				set aside for serving. Stir in 2 Tbsp. finely grated Parmesan.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 4</h3>
				Add pasta and ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid to sauce. Cook, tossing often
				and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed (you’ll probably use
				about ¾ cup), until pasta is coated and glossy. Season with freshly
				ground black pepper; taste and season with kosher salt if needed.
			</li>
